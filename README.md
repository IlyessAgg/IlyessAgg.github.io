### Predicting hotel review ratings based on text review

The goal of the project is to be able to predict the rating of a review based on text review.

|     | Reviews Text | Reviews Rating |
| :-: | :----------: | :------------: |
| 1 | This hotel was nice and quiet. Did not know, ... | 3 |
| 2 | Not cheap but excellent location. Price is ... | 5 |
| 3 | Parking was horrible, somebody ran into my ... | 3 |
| . . . | . . . | . . . |

After preprocessing the text (*tokenization, stopwords, lemmatization, etc.*), I used *SentimentAnalyzer* in the nltk library to rate the sentiment of a review  (~ 1 means positive, ~ -1 means negative). From that grade I build a classifier that would predict the rating of the review.

Another method I implemented was to use [fasttext](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/supervised-tutorial.html), a library for learning of word embeddings and text classification created by Facebook's AI Research lab.

### *Grand DÃ©bat* synthesis 

The goal of this project is to generate a synthesis of the data created by French citizens to answer some political open questions. 

<div align="center">
    <img src='imgs/TSNE_environment.png' height='600'>
    <p><i>TSNE Visualization of corpus</i></p>
</div>

My approach focused on the environmental questions. I also used N_Grams and LDA to pick up the subjects that came up most often in the answers. The results were issues like overconsumption, greenhouse gas emissions, extinction of species, fossil/nuclear energy, etc. Finally, I looked at whether those subjects emerged in the summary of Emmanuel Macron's appearance in the ***Grand DÃ©bat*** emission.

### Scrapping & Classification of 2 dog breeds ðŸ“œ<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IlyessAgg/TDs_ESILV/blob/master/TD6_CNN.ipynb" align="right"><img align="right" src="imgs/jupyter_icon.png"></a>

This project was an introduction to the use of CNNs. Using *Selenium*, we scrapped images of both akita inu and giant schnauzer.

    <img src='imgs/dogs.png' width='600'>
    <p><i>Example of images (giant schnauzer on the left, akita inu on the right)</i></p>
</div>
We built a basic CNN structure for this classification task. We then built another network using a pretrained model (VGG19 with Imagenet) and compared the results. Finally, we looked at the feature maps to gain a better understanding of the features detected by our model.

### Activity prediction based on physiological and motion data <a href="https://github.com/IlyessAgg/PPG-DaLiA-Dataset-Analysis" align="right"><img align="right" src="imgs/GitHub-Mark-32px.png"></a><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IlyessAgg/PPG-DaLiA-Dataset-Analysis/blob/master/Project.ipynb" align="right"><img align="right" src="imgs/jupyter_icon.png"></a><a href="https://github.com/IlyessAgg/PPG-DaLiA-Dataset-Analysis/blob/master/Report.pdf" align="right"><img align="right" src="imgs/PowerPoint_icon.png"></a>

**[PPG-DaLiA](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/PPG-DaLiA)** is a multimodal dataset featuring physiological and motion data, recorded from both a wrist- and a chest-worn device, of 15 subjects while performing a wide range of activities under close to real-life conditions. This dataset is designed for PPG-based heart rate estimation but our instructor challenged us to predict the activity of the subjects.

<div align="center">
    <img src='imgs/heartrate_chart.png'>
    <p><i>Plot of the heartrate during the different activities.</i></p>
</div>

The purpose of this project was to deal with diverse sources of data and determine how to make use of them for our task. For example, each sensor had a different frequency so understanding and standardizing the different attributes was the essential part of the project. 

Since the dataset provides the data for only 15 subjects, I aimed my study at looking how the model developed would perform on unseen data.

### Chest XRay Classifier ðŸ“œ<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IlyessAgg/mLcourse/blob/master/%5BCoursera%5D%20AI%20For%20Medicine%20Specialization/1%20-%20AI%20For%20Medical%20Diagnosis/Week%201%20-%20Disease%20detection/W1_Assignment_ChestXRay_Classifier.ipynb" align="right"><img align="right" src="imgs/jupyter_icon.png"></a>

The goal of this project was to build a chest X-ray classifier based on the [ChestX-ray8 dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315). Each of the X-ray images is associated with 14 different pathological conditions.

We used transfer learning to retrain a DenseNet model, built a weighted loss function to address class imbalance, and visualized our model's activity using [Grad-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391).

### Brain tumor segmentation ðŸ“œ <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IlyessAgg/mLcourse/blob/master/%5BCoursera%5D%20AI%20For%20Medicine%20Specialization/1%20-%20AI%20For%20Medical%20Diagnosis/Week%203%20-%20Image%20segmentation%20on%20MRI/W3_Assignment_Brain_Tumor_AutoSegmentation_for_MRI.ipynb" align="right"><img align="right" src="imgs/jupyter_icon.png"></a>

The goal of this project was to build a neural network to automatically segment tumor regions in brain, using MRI scans.

<div align="center">
    <img src="imgs/mri_gif.png" alt='Mri'/>
    <p><i>Visualization of an MRI image.</i></p>
</div>

We generated sub-volumes of our data and built a 3D U-net network. We looked at different metrics to evaluate our model (soft dice loss, dice coefficient, sensitivity, specificity) and applied those on entire scans.

### Detecting breast cancer metastases <a href="https://github.com/IlyessAgg/Metastasis_Detection" align="right"><img align="right" src="imgs/GitHub-Mark-32px.png"></a>

The goal of the challenge is to detect **lymph node metastases** in histological images of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Each patient is described by **1,000** small images (tiles) extracted from one whole-slide image. 

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7LBRCxWF/Capture-d-e-cran-2019-01-25-a-10-45-05.png" alt='Tiles_images'/>
    <p><i>Example of two tiles (non-tumoral on the left, tumoral on the right)</i></p>
</div>

Additionally, we have **11** patients for which each tile was annotated by a pathologist (total of **10,024** annotated tiles). Based on these annotated patients, I built a model that predicts the **probability of metastases in the tile**. Next, I computed the probabilities for every tile of the non-annotated patients. Based on these predictions, I built a model that predicts whether or not **a patient has any metastases** in its slide.

### Predicting lung cancer survival time <a href="https://github.com/IlyessAgg/Owkin_Challenge" align="right"><img align="right" src="imgs/GitHub-Mark-32px.png"></a><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IlyessAgg/Owkin_Challenge/blob/master/Challenge_Second_Try.ipynb" align="right"><img align="right" src="imgs/jupyter_icon.png"></a>


The goal of the challenge is to predict **survival time** of patients diagnosed with lung cancer, based on 3-dimensional radiology images (CT scans). Clinical data of patients and radiomics (quantitative features extracted from the scan) are also provided.

<div class='images' align='center'>
    <div style='display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;'>
        <img src="imgs/lung_ct.png" alt='Lung_ct_Image' width='235' height='100'/>
        <p><i>CT Scan</i></p>
    </div>
    <div style='display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;'>
        <img src="imgs/lung_ct_and_mask.png" alt='Mask_Image' width='235' height='100'/>
        <p><i>Mask of tumor (green part)</i></p>
    </div>
</div>

Based on the imaging modality (scan & mask), I re-computed radiomics features using [PyRadiomics](https://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (the radiomics data provided was only a subset of what could be computed using that library). After a feature selection process using ***VIF***, I built a **Cox Proportional Hazard** model to predict the survival time of the patients.

    <img src="imgs/loadingcircles_icon.png" width='20' style="vertical-align:center;">
    <span><i> ongoing</i></span>
</div>

The goal of this [challenge](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17094) is to segment liver lesions in contrastÂ­-enhanced abdominal CT scans. Liver segmentation and tumor burden estimation are also evaluated. The data and segmentations are provided by various clinical sites around the world.

<div align="center">
    <img src="imgs/liver_segmentation.png" alt='Liver_scan_images' width='750'/>
    <p><i>Example of a CT scan</i></p>
</div>

The first step of the process was to create a function that generates sub-volumes from our images. I also made sure that the sub-volumes extracted were relevant (i.e. at least 5% of something other than the background class). I am now building a U-Net architecture to complete the task of segmentation.
